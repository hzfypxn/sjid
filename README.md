The leisure centre was not too busy at that time in the afternoon. Justin DeWinter entered the male changing room to change for his squash game with his wife. I was already in changing, and was bollock naked searching for my speedos in my bag knowing that DeWinter was eyeing me up. I turned with the speedos in my hand having "found" them and acknowledged his entry.

"Hi " I said smiling.

"Hello" DeWinter replied also smiling and started to remove his shirt.

I stood there still naked full frontal to him.

"Are you our MP?" I feigned questioned interest.

" Afraid I am young man"
